        <h1>Vegetables and Fruits</h1>
        <p>are usually classified on the basis of the part of the plant that is used for food. 
        The root vegetables include beets, carrots, radishes, sweet potatoes, and turnips. 
        Stem vegetables include asparagus and kohlrabi. Among the edible tubers, or underground stems, are potatoes. 
        The leaf and leafstalk vegetables include brussels sprouts, cabbage, celery, lettuce, rhubarb, and spinach. 
        Among the bulb vegetables are garlic, leeks, and onions. 
        The head, or flower, vegetables include artichokes, broccoli, and cauliflower. 
        The fruits commonly considered vegetables by virtue of their use include cucumbers, eggplant, okra, sweet corn, squash, peppers, and tomatoes. 
        Seed vegetables are usually legumes, such as peas and beans.</p> 
        <p>Vegetables may be washed, sorted, graded, cut, and packaged for sale as fresh products. 
        Fresh vegetables are subject to quick aging and spoilage, 
        but their storage life can be extended by such preservation processes as dehydration, canning, freezing, fermenting, or pickling.</p>
        <p>When a vegetable is harvested, it is cut off from its source of water and nourishment. 
            It continues to transpire and loses moisture as it does so, a process most noticeable in the wilting of green leafy crops. 
            Harvesting root vegetables when they are fully mature improves their storage life, but alternatively, these root crops can be left in the ground and harvested over an extended period. 
        </p>
        <p>The objective of preserving vegetables is to extend their availability for consumption or marketing purposes. 
        The aim is to harvest the food at its maximum state of palatability and nutritional value, and preserve these qualities for an extended period.
        The main causes of deterioration in vegetables after they are gathered are the actions of naturally-occurring enzymes and the spoilage caused by micro-organisms.
         Canning and freezing are the most commonly used techniques, and vegetables preserved by these methods are generally similar in nutritional value to comparable fresh products with regards to carotenoids, 
        vitamin E, minerals. and dietary fiber.</p>
